  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Korma is prepared by marinating and then braising a meat in a yogurt or cream base. The dish is traditionally cooked on low heat for around an hour until the meat is tender and the sauce turns into a rich and creamy glaze.

    When the Mughals came to India from Central Asia, they brought with them their own cuisine, including the slow braised, yogurt-based (or sometimes cream-based) dish, korma.
