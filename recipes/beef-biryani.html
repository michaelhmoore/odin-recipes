  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Beef Biryani is a rice-based dish made with spices, rice (usually basmati) and beef, mutton, fish, eggs, or vegetables. The name is derived from the Persian word berya(n), which means "fried" or "roasted". Biryani was believed to have been invented in the kitchen of the Muslim Mughal Emperors.
 
It is very popular in South Asia and is a key element of the South Asian cuisine. 

The spices and condiments used in biryani may include, but are not limited to, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace pepper, cloves,  cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint leaves, ginger, onions, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.   For a non-vegetarian biryani, the main ingredient that accompanies the spices is the meatâ€”beef, chicken, goat, lamb, fish or shrimp. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or Raita, korma, curry, a sour dish of eggplant (brinjal), boiled egg and salad.
